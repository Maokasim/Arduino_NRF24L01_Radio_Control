# Arduino_NRF24L01_Radio_Control
It is Plane Radio Control system based on Arduino and NRF24L01
It can transmit up to 32 bytes packages, has telemetry function and estimated max range 1 km 

Repository includes 2 main folder PlaneTransmitter and PlaneReceiver
Thus PlaneTransmitter includes code for transmitter and PlaneReceiver includes code for receiver

Code was write in units form, so it is separated units for each task e.g. NRF24Transmit.cpp for transmitting information and DisplayInformation.cpp for displaying information on lcd 

I highly recomend use Visual Studio Code and Platformio extention to work with all code
